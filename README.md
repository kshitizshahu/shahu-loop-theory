# shahu-loop-theory
Shahu Loop Theory is a speculative multiversal model by Kshitiz Shahu that proposes time travel to the past by reversing a universe's entropy using energy extracted from a parallel universe. It forms a causal loop where the sacrificed universe is eventually reborn, preserving energy and information.
