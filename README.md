## üåÄ Summary

The **Shahu Loop Theory** is a speculative model that proposes time travel to the past is possible if an entire universe‚Äôs entropy is reversed. To do this, energy equal to that universe‚Äôs total is required ‚Äî which must be extracted from a **parallel universe**. As one universe reverses time, the other collapses. But due to the **butterfly effect**, this reversed universe evolves differently and eventually becomes the original sacrificed one, forming a **causal loop**.

## üî¨ Scientific Components

- **Entropy Reversal:** Time's arrow is governed by entropy. Reversing time = reversing entropy.
- **Multiversal Energy Transfer:** Another universe donates energy, conserving total energy.
- **Causal Loop Closure:** The altered timeline evolves back into the donor universe.
- **Conservation Laws:** Energy and information are preserved across universes.

## üåå Philosophical Meaning

> ‚ÄúTo reverse a universe, you must sacrifice another. But by altering time, you make that universe reborn. This is not destruction. It is exchange. It is the Shahu Loop.‚Äù

## üë§ About the Author

Kshitiz Shahu is a young theorist from Nepal, born in 2006. Fascinated by time travel, entropy, and multiverse physics, he developed this theory to explore a new way to think about causality, sacrifice, and rebirth on a cosmic scale.
# shahu-loop-theory
Shahu Loop Theory is a speculative multiversal model by Kshitiz Shahu that proposes time travel to the past by reversing a universe's entropy using energy extracted from a parallel universe. It forms a causal loop where the sacrificed universe is eventually reborn, preserving energy and information.
